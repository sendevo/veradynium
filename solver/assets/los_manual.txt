NAME  
   los - Line of Sight calculation between coordinates  

SYNOPSIS  
   los [OPTIONS]... -f [FILE] -p1 [lat1 lon1 alt1] -p2 [lat2 lon2 alt2] -o [OUTPUT_FORMAT]  

DESCRIPTION:  
   This program determines if two points are in line of sight depending on the terrain elevation (data provided by user) of the area. Earth curvature is not taken into account.  

OPTIONS:  
   -h, --help     Display this help message.  
   -f, --file     File with terrain elevation data. Must be int CSV format (lat, lon, alt).  
   -p1            Coordinates and altitude of point 1 (lat lon alt). Altitude is optional.  
   -p2            Coordinates and altitude of point 2  (lat lon alt). Altitude is optional.  
   -o, --output   (optional) Output format. Must be "json" or "text". Default value is "text".  

EXAMPLE:  
   los -f elevation.csv -p1 36.733780 -91.237743 2.0 -p2 36.712818 -91.221097 2.5  
   
   - Check if the provided coordinates (near Mark Twain National Forest, USA) are in line of sight. Output will be:  

   "Line of sight from (36.7338, -91.2377, 2m) to (36.7128, -91.2211, 2.5m), distance of 2762.97 m: CLEAR"
   
   - In case of using json format (adding "-o json" argument), output will be: 

   {
      "point1": {"lat": 36.7338, "lon": -91.2377, "height_m": 2},
      "point2": {"lat": 36.7128, "lon": -91.2211, "height_m": 2.5},
      "distance_m": 2762.97,
      "line_of_sight": true
   }
