   This manual is part of the veradynium project. See project documentation at: https://github.com/sendevo/veradynium  

NAME  
   eval - Computes the connection of end-devices to nodes.  

SYNOPSIS  
   eval -f [EM_FILE] -g [GEOJSON_FILE] -o [OUTPUT_FORMAT]

DESCRIPTION:  
   This program computes the allocation of the LoRaWAN network composed by a set of end-devices and a set of gateways taking into account the terrain elevation of the area. The program requires both files with the terrain elevation data and the network topology in GeoJSON format. The program returns the connected end-devices of each gateway.

OPTIONS:  
   -h, --help     Display this help message.  
   -f, --em_file  File with terrain elevation data. Must be in CSV format (lat, lng, alt).  
   -g, --nw_file  File with the current network's nodes locations. Must be in JSON (GeoJSON) format.  
   -o, --output   (optional) Output format. Must be "json" or "text". Default value is "text".  

EXAMPLES:  
   compute_allocation -f elevation.csv -g network.json -o json
