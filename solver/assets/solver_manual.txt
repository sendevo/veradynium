PROLOG  
   This manual is part of the veradynium project. See project documentation at: https://github.com/sendevo/veradynium  

NAME  
   solver - Gateway placement problem solver.  

SYNOPSIS  
   solver [OPTIONS]... -f [EM_FILE] -g [GEOJSON_FILE] -o [OUTPUT_FORMAT]  

DESCRIPTION:  
   Given a geojson file containing the locations of end-devices and current gateways, and the terrain elevation file, this program approximates the current energy consumption of the network and suggest a optimal locations for gateways in order to minimize gateway number and energy consumption.  

OPTIONS:  
   -h, --help     Display this help message.  
   -f, --em_file  File with terrain elevation data. Must be in CSV format (lat, lng, alt).  
   -g, --nw_file  File with the current network's nodes locations. Must be in JSON (GeoJSON) format.  
   -o, --output   (optional) Output format. Must be "json" or "text". Default value is "text".  

EXAMPLE:  
   solver -f elevation.csv -g network.json -o json
